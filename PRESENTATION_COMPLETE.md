## üìã Presentation Flow

### Recommended Timing (45-60 minutes):

1. **Introduction (8-10 min)**
   - Why animations matter in modern web apps
   - Angular's approach vs other frameworks
   - Performance benefits demonstration

2. **Core Concepts (10-12 min)**
   - Explain triggers, states, transitions with live examples
   - Show the mental model of Angular animations
   - Interactive concept exploration

3. **Practical Patterns (12-15 min)**
   - Common animation patterns every developer needs
   - Live coding demonstration
   - Route transitions and micro-interactions

4. **Advanced Features (8-10 min)**
   - Complex animations and performance optimization
   - Parent-child animation coordination
   - Keyframe sequences

5. **Interactive Playground (10-12 min)**
   - Audience participation with real-time controls
   - Demonstrate different easing functions and their feel
   - Show generated code and explain patterns

6. **Performance & Best Practices (5-8 min)**
   - Production considerations
   - Accessibility requirements
   - Performance monitoring and optimization

### üí° Presentation Tips:

1. **Start with the "why"** - Show the business value of good animations
2. **Use the interactive features** - Let the audience experiment
3. **Emphasize performance** - Always mention GPU acceleration
4. **Show real code** - Use the generated code examples
5. **Respect accessibility** - Demonstrate the reduced motion toggle
6. **End with actionable advice** - Give concrete next steps

## üîß Customization Options

### Adding New Slides:
1. Create new component in `/slides/slide-X-name/`
2. Import in `presentation.ts`
3. Add to slides array and template switch

### Modifying Animations:
- Edit `/shared/animations.ts` for global animations
- Individual slide animations in component files
- Use the playground slide to experiment with new effects

### Theming:
- Global styles in `/app/styles.scss`
- Individual slide themes in component SCSS files
- CSS variables for easy color scheme changes

## üéØ Learning Outcomes
